# Role-Based Routing Test Guide

## Problem Fixed
Service providers (Plumber, Electrician, Cleaner) were not seeing their dashboard and tickets pages because they were being served the wrong interface.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Created RoleBasedRoute Component** - Automatically routes users to appropriate interfaces based on their roles
2. **Updated App.tsx** - Uses role-based routing for `/dashboard`, `/tickets`, and `/tickets/new` routes
3. **Added Debug Component** - Shows current user roles and expected interface for testing

## Test Users Available
The following test users are seeded in the database:

| Email | Password | Role | Expected Interface |
|-------|----------|------|-------------------|
| admin@cafm.com | Admin123! | Admin | Standard Dashboard |
| manager@cafm.com | Manager123! | AssetManager | Standard Dashboard |
| plumber@cafm.com | Plumber123! | Plumber | üé® Professional Interface |
| electrician@cafm.com | Electric123! | Electrician | üé® Professional Interface |
| cleaner@cafm.com | Cleaner123! | Cleaner | üé® Professional Interface |
| user@cafm.com | User123! | EndUser | Standard Dashboard |

## How to Test

### Step 1: Start the Application
1. Frontend should already be running on http://localhost:5173
2. Start the backend: `cd CAFMSystem.API && dotnet run`

### Step 2: Test Service Provider Login
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/login
2. Login with **plumber@cafm.com** / **Plumber123!**
3. Navigate to `/dashboard`
4. **Expected Result**: You should see:
   - üîç Blue debug box showing "Is Service Provider: ‚úÖ YES"
   - üé® Colorful professional interface with gradient background
   - "Welcome back, John! üé®" header
   - Professional layout with sidebar navigation

### Step 3: Test Regular User Login
1. Logout and login with **user@cafm.com** / **User123!**
2. Navigate to `/dashboard`
3. **Expected Result**: You should see:
   - üîç Blue debug box showing "Is Service Provider: ‚ùå NO"
   - Standard Bootstrap interface
   - Regular MainLayout with navbar

### Step 4: Test Tickets Page
1. While logged in as plumber, go to `/tickets`
2. **Expected Result**: Professional tickets interface with role-based filtering
3. Logout and login as regular user, go to `/tickets`
4. **Expected Result**: Standard tickets interface

## Key Features Fixed
- ‚úÖ Service providers now see their professional dashboard
- ‚úÖ Service providers now see their professional tickets page
- ‚úÖ Role-based routing works automatically
- ‚úÖ Debug information shows current user roles
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained for other user types

## Files Modified
- `cafm-system-frontend/src/App.tsx` - Added role-based routing
- `cafm-system-frontend/src/components/auth/RoleBasedRoute.tsx` - New component
- `cafm-system-frontend/src/components/debug/RoleDebugInfo.tsx` - New debug component
- `cafm-system-frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` - Added debug info
- `cafm-system-frontend/src/pages/ProfessionalDashboard.tsx` - Added debug info

## Troubleshooting
If service providers still see the wrong interface:
1. Check the debug box - it shows exactly what roles the user has
2. Verify the user is logged in with correct credentials
3. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
4. Clear browser cache and try again

## Next Steps
Once testing is complete, the debug components can be removed for production deployment.
